 *  Created on: 14 Feb 2013
 *      Author: Maxime Vincent
 * Description: Virtually the most simple demo that can be run on an ARM MCU.
 *              The target is barely running - all clocks are off, the core is
 *              just executing a few simple instructions.
 *
 *     Purpose: Purpose is to demonstrate an openocd-gdb setup to flash and 
 *              step through code on the target.
 *
 *     Context: Written in the context of the Embedded C course by TASS Belgium.
